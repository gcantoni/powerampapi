# Poweramp Intent APIs Example
============================================

This is an example project that demonstrates Poweramp v2 and v3 Intent based APIs. These APIs are focused on simplicity: you can just
throw a simple Intent to Poweramp to play something, command Poweramp to do something, or get some Poweramp state from the published Intents.
While being simple Intent APIs provide almost complete control over Poweramp.

Please see: [../poweramp_api_lib/readme.md](../poweramp_api_lib/readme.md) for details. Also see comments/doc-comments in Example project source files.
